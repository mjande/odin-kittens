# Odin Kittens

The Odin Kittens API is a simple data-producing API that returns info on kittens in the database. It is a learning project to gain practice in creating and using APIS with the Ruby on Rails Framework, and it is being completed as a part of the curriculum at [theodinproject.com](theodinproject.com). Specs for this project can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-kittens-api#your-task).
